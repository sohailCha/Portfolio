# Portfolio
## This is a website built using pure HTML5 and CSS3.

The Website is just a gist of what a person can do with **HTML5 & CSS3** languages. Although these languages are not considered as programming languages,still every programmer must know the basics about these languages as they are on the front-end of each and every website. 

This project is my effort of creating a website without using any **CSS** libraries such as *Bootstrap,Materialize,skeleteon etc*.

The website has a navigation bar that helps the user to navigate through the web-page, the navigation bar consist of a **_brand name_** that allows the user to directly go to the *portfolio* section and a *contact me* button through which they can contact me.

This website has three main section, the **first one** consists of a *quick intro*, the **second one** consist all the *information about me* and the **last section** is the *footer section* where you can find social media links.
